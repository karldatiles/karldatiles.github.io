Enhypen was the title given to the group during the live broadcast of I-Land's episode. Enhypen's name is derived etymologically from the hyphen sign (-), which stands for "Connection, Discovery, & Growth." Enhypen is a South Korean boy band formed by Belift Lab, a former joint venture between CJ ENM and Hybe Corporation, through the 2020 survival competition show I-Land. The group is composed of seven members: Heeseung, Jay, Jake, Sunghoon, Sunoo, Jungwon, and Ni-ki.
